🧿 oracle 0.8.6 — Guidance without the guesswork.
Reattach via: oracle session design-a-universal-web-scraping
Prompt:
Design a universal web scraping architecture for an AI agent. Requirements:
works on 95%+ of websites including CF-protected, free/open-source only, Python,
headless Linux. I have curl_cffi (5/6 CF sites, 0.4s), rebrowser-playwright
stealth (5/6, 7s), Camoufox (6/6, 10s). Questions: 1) Optimal tiered
architecture? 2) Scrapling vs Crawl4AI vs custom stack? 3) Best content
extractor (Trafilatura F1=0.958)? 4) Cookie/session management? 5) What am I
missing?
