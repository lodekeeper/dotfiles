# Research Plan: Memory Management & Indexing Improvements

**Date:** 2026-02-28
**Requested by:** Nico (voice message)
**Goal:** Find better solutions for long-term memory, lookup/indexing, and access patterns.

## Sub-Questions
1. (Web Survey) What memory architectures are AI agents using?
2. (File Analysis) What's our current memory setup — inventory, access patterns, pain points?
3. (Web Survey) What indexing/retrieval approaches exist for persistent AI memory?
4. (Deep Reasoning) What's the optimal architecture for our constraints?

## Cost: Free (sub-agents + Oracle browser)
