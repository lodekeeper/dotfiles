# Research Plan: Next High-Impact Lodestar Project

## Problem Statement
Find the top 3 exciting, high-impact projects for Lodestar (CL-only, large scope, can start immediately). Should demonstrate Lodestar's capabilities and contribute to the Ethereum ecosystem, similar to the EIP-7782 6-second slots PoC.

## Sub-Questions

### SQ1 (Type A — Web survey): What's hot in Ethereum CL R&D right now?
- ethresear.ch recent posts (last 3 months)
- EIP tracker: new/draft CL EIPs
- AllCoreDevs consensus calls: what's being discussed
- Twitter/forum buzz: what excites researchers

### SQ2 (Type D — Cross-client survey): What PoCs/experiments have other clients done?
- Lighthouse, Prysm, Teku, Nimbus, Grandine GitHub repos
- Look for experimental branches, PoC PRs, research implementations
- What has been done that Lodestar hasn't?

### SQ3 (Type A — Web survey): Shorter-slot-times & related research
- shorter-slot-times channel in eth R&D
- Related research: single-slot finality, epoch restructuring, preconfirmations
- What's the next logical step after 6-second slots?

### SQ4 (Type B — Codebase/spec analysis): What CL spec features are unimplemented?
- Check consensus-specs for features not yet in Lodestar
- Look at draft EIPs with consensus-specs PRs
- Identify spec tests that are skipped/disabled

### SQ5 (Type A — Web survey): Ethereum community wishlist
- What do validators/operators want?
- What do researchers say the biggest CL gaps are?
- Performance, UX, security improvements needed
