# Devnet debugging (hosted / remote) — Lodestar lens

This skill **layers on panda's own debugging skills** — it does not replace them. For the data and the procedure, use panda:

- **`query` skill** — the panda data/query API. Discover datasources, tables, and worked queries *live* (`panda getting-started`, `panda schema`, `panda search examples "<topic>"`). **Don't hardcode datasource/table names** — they're owned by the proxy and change.
- **`investigate` skill** — routes local-vs-remote and loads the canonical runbook. For a hosted devnet, run `panda search runbooks "debug devnet"` and follow it: it owns the flow (Dora shape, `external.otel_logs`, ethnode RPC, debug-report output).

devnet-debug adds only what panda has no knowledge of: the **Lodestar interpretation**, the cross-client correlation **method**, and a **ChainSafe infra secondary POV**.

Not this skill: local Kurtosis → `kurtosis-devnet`; join with a local node → `join-devnet`; mainnet networking repro → `local-mainnet-debug`; Lodestar RC metrics → `release-metrics`; heap leaks → `lodestar-heapsnapshots`; bulk log triage → `log-reader`.

## Flow

1. **Preflight panda.** `skills/devnet-debug/scripts/ensure-panda-auth.sh` — heals the cred-file perms so the containerized `panda-server` can read them, and reports auth state. **Token refresh is handled by `panda-server` itself; do NOT run `scripts/panda/panda-reauth`** (the browser/GitHub-cookie device flow is disabled per nflaig 2026-06-19). If `datasources=null` persists, a human runs `panda auth login` once. Then panda's own readiness check: `scripts/debug/check-devnet-routing-readiness.py <network>` (exit 2 = datasources not ready; `panda datasources --json` returning `{"datasources": null}` means *not ready*, not "network absent").
2. **Run the panda procedure.** `panda search runbooks "debug devnet"` → follow it. Use the `query` skill / `panda search examples` for query patterns; discover names live.
3. **Apply the Lodestar lens** (below).
4. **Drop to ChainSafe infra** (below) only when you need Lodestar internals panda doesn't ship.

## Triage — symptom → first look

Quick public snapshot (no auth/panda): `skills/devnet-debug/scripts/net-health.sh <network>` → finality, active forks, node→client topology. Then:

| Symptom | First look |
|---------|-----------|
| Not finalizing / low participation | `dora.get_network_overview` (or `/api/v1/epoch/latest`: `finalized`, participation) → per-client error signatures in `otel-logs` |
| A client stuck / on its own fork | Dora `/forks` (who diverged) → that client's **own** `otel-logs` → its live beacon API via the `bn-` gateway |
| ePBS / Gloas (glamsterdam) | payload-envelope / PTC / builder errors in the stuck client's logs (e.g. `payload envelope … not found in forkchoice`); confirm `GLOAS_FORK_EPOCH` (`cl/config.yaml`) is actually active |
| PeerDAS data columns missing | data-column-sidecar tables (discover via `panda schema` / `search`) + custody/sampling errors in CL logs |
| Peers dropping / low count | Lodestar `lodestar_peers_by_client_count` (`:5054` / Prometheus); peer/disconnect lines in `otel-logs`; pin the offending client |
| Lodestar block production failing | SSH `:5052` `/eth/v1/debug/fork_choice`; ChainSafe Loki debug logs; `scripts/debug/devnet-triage.sh <node>` |
| Did the network pass its tests? | Assertoor `/api/v1/test_runs` (failed runs) |

Always read the **failing client's own** logs — don't infer its bug from Lodestar's side. Once root-caused, hand the mechanism + the exact log lines to that client's team (don't just say "looks like X").

## Network metadata & explorers

Every hosted devnet has a landing page `https://<network>.ethpandaops.io/` linking all services + machine-readable config — scope a network from there.

- **`config.<network>.ethpandaops.io`:** `/api/v1/nodes/inventory` (authoritative node→client map — client, image tag, ENR, peer_id, `bn-` beacon URI per node), `/api/v1/nodes/validator-ranges` (validator index → node), `/cl/config.yaml` (fork schedule, e.g. `GLOAS_FORK_EPOCH`; far-future `18446744073709551615` = not scheduled), `/cl/genesis.ssz`, `/el/genesis.json`. Client versions also in repo `ethpandaops/<network>s` (`…/images.yaml`).
- **Services:** `rpc.` (EL RPC), `beacon.` (public CL REST), `dora.`, `forkmon.`, `syncoor.` (sync tests), `assertoor.` (network test runner — `/api/v1/test_runs` & `/api/v1/tests` JSON for pass/fail), `checkpoint-sync.`, `faucet.`.
- **Dora — prefer the panda module:** `from ethpandaops import dora` → `dora.get_network_overview(net)` (epoch/slot/finality/participation/validator counts), `get_epoch`/`get_slot`/`get_validator(s)`, `link_*`. Quick raw curl (no auth): `/api/v1/epoch/latest` (finality + participation), `/api/v1/slot/<n>`, `/api/v1/slots`, `/api/v1/validators`, `/api/v1/validator/<idx>` (JSON); `/forks` is the HTML fork view (one row per fork = a split).

Full endpoint catalog + examples: `references/network-metadata.md`.

## Query discipline — prefer `panda execute`

panda's whole point is the **sandbox Python runtime**, not raw SQL dumps. A `panda clickhouse query` returning thousands of rows floods context ("context rot") — the exact thing panda was built to avoid (see the ethpandaops panda post). So:

- **Aggregate in the sandbox, return summaries.** `panda execute --code '...'` with the `ethpandaops` lib (`clickhouse`/`prometheus`/`loki`/`dora`/`specs`) → return `df.describe()`, group-by counts, or top-N — not raw rows.
- **Logs:** group by error signature, return the top distinct patterns + counts, then drill into a couple of examples. Don't dump hundreds of lines.
- **Raw `panda clickhouse query` only for tiny results** (a count, a handful of rows).
- **Sessions** for multi-step: `panda execute --session <id>` keeps the sandbox warm; cache an expensive pull to `/workspace/*.parquet` and reuse it next call.
- **Spec constants inline:** `from ethpandaops import specs; specs.get_constant("MAX_EFFECTIVE_BALANCE")`.

Execute-based otel-logs example: `references/panda-recipes.md`.

## Lodestar lens — is it us?

On an interop devnet the high-value move: when a client is stuck/forked, read **that client's own** logs — don't infer its bug from Lodestar's peer view. The runbook's `external.otel_logs` carries every client; key by network + `host.name` (`<cl>-<el>-<n>`, e.g. `prysm-nethermind-2`), split CL/EL via `log.file.name`, match severity on `Body`. Confirm current table/column names via `panda schema` / `panda search examples` before trusting any literal.

When Lodestar **is** implicated, cross-check head/finality/peers, then go to the secondary POV for internals.

Worked example (Prysm "every node a fork" on glam-devnet-5 → `Execution payload envelope … not found in forkchoice`) and the exact otel-logs query pattern: `references/panda-recipes.md`.

## Secondary POV — ChainSafe infra (panda has none of this)

Use when you need Lodestar internals panda doesn't carry: live fork-choice dump, debug-level logs, heap/CPU profiles, exact peer-by-client counts.

- **SSH (Lodestar nodes only):** `ssh devops@lodestar-<el>-<n>.srv.<network>.ethpandaops.io` (key `~/.ssh/id_ed25519` = the lodekeeper.keys entry). Beacon REST `localhost:5052`, metrics `localhost:5054/metrics`. Other-client nodes reject the key — read theirs via panda otel-logs (logs) or the `bn-` gateway below (live beacon API). Peer-by-client: `lodestar_peers_by_client_count{client="Prysm"}`.
- **Any-client beacon API (`bn-` gateway):** reaches **every** client's beacon API (Prysm/LH/Teku/Nimbus/Grandine/Lodestar), unlike the SSH key. `AUTH=$(awk -F': ' '/^<network>:/{print $NF}' ~/.config/ethpandaops/bn-basic-auth)` then `curl "https://$AUTH@bn-<cl>-<el>-<n>.srv.<network>.ethpandaops.io/<beacon-path>"` — HTTP basic auth (user `eth`). Use for live head/finality/peers/version/syncing of a stuck *non-Lodestar* node, and Lodestar debug routes (`/eth/v1/lodestar/...`) on ours. Password is per-devnet and **not in this repo** — stored `0600` at `~/.config/ethpandaops/bn-basic-auth`; get fresh per-devnet creds from Nico / the devnet config. (Bare `<node>.<network>` without `bn-` 404s.)
- **ChainSafe Grafana Loki:** ChainSafe's own Lodestar devnet nodes ship **debug-level** logs to Loki (datasource 4) under `group="beacon_devnet"`, `network="dev"`, instances `devnet-ax41-0..3`. Faster than panda for Lodestar peer/disconnect/sync digs, no OIDC. Token: `eval "$(grep '^export GRAFANA' ~/.bashrc)"`. See `grafana-loki` skill.
- **One-shot per-node snapshot:** before a longer run, preflight telemetry with `scripts/debug/devnet-triage.sh <node> --check-only --require-grafana` when Loki/Prometheus are needed. Autonomous wrappers should use `--check-only --json` for machine-readable readiness. Then `scripts/debug/devnet-triage.sh <node>` pulls that node's recent error logs (Loki) + key metrics (Prometheus) into a markdown report (needs `GRAFANA_TOKEN`).

## Iteration Log

Track what works and what doesn't after each use:

| Date | Network / issue | What worked | What to improve |
|------|-----------------|-------------|-----------------|
| 2026-06-16 | glamsterdam-devnet-5 — Prysm "every node a fork" | Cross-client `otel-logs` surfaced Prysm's own `Execution payload envelope … not found in forkchoice` lines — named the mechanism, not just "looks like Prysm". `config/api/v1/nodes/inventory` + the `bn-` gateway gave topology/versions/live beacon API without SSH. | First pass dumped raw log rows into context (costly) → switched to `panda execute` aggregation. Confirm live table/datasource names via `panda schema` / `search examples` before querying — don't trust the literals here. |
